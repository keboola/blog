As an intern at Keboola, I’ve learned that the world of data is constantly changing, it requires you to be fast and it’s full of Czech people. With no experience in data at all, the first weeks were overwhelming to say the least but now I can proudly pronounce SQL (pronounced sequel **not** ess-queue-el for all my non-data people).

One of the hardest parts starting at a SaaS company is definitely understanding the product but I can definitely say I have a much better understanding of Keboola even though I don’t know R or Python.  **Here are a few things that I learned during my time here:**

**Data is everything:** it’s 2019 people! Data is the driving force behind every decision made whether it’s in business or in your personal life. Even if you’re in marketing, finance, operations or hospitality - data is everything! I knew data was important for businesses but now knowing that some businesses have full on data teams to ensure that their data is being utilized to its fullest capacity; I understand that data isn’t just a trendy topic but a powerful resource to making great business decisions. Sometimes you don’t even realize how impactful data is in our everyday lives until you see it.

**Don’t get too comfortable:** Many of my friends who are working at startups told me that you wear lots of hat when working in a startup. I thought I had a good grasp and understanding of what wearing lots of hats meant until I **really** started wearing lots of hats. Whether that be coordinating events, creating graphics or filming videos alongside my typical marketing duties, there’s countless hats you will wear in a startup - which also means you’ll learn a lot in a short period of time.

**White Rock is beautiful:** Despite the 40 minute commute to work most days, I have definitely seen the beauty of White Rock! The stereotype that White Rock’s filled with old retired people is definitely no longer true especially with so many young people moving out here. Here are a few places you should definitely check out if you’re in town

1. Islands Cafe
2. The Wooden Spoon
3. The White Rock Beach
4. White Rock Pier

**The people**: Like I said earlier, there are a lot of Czech people that work at Keboola. Since our company was founded  in the Czech Republic, this obviously makes a lot of sense, but I definitely love the personalities of all my coworkers. They are super funny and love to have a great time. I also can’t forget to mention our 4 legged friends who hang out with us every day too.

It’s crazy to think I’ve been at our beautiful loft for 4 months already. I have definitely learned a lot about marketing and the importance of data in startups, companies and enterprises but no SQL… yet!
