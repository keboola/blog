# **I can finally run the whole company using reliable data**

The Keboola punkish roots are also reflected in the way we are closing our new business deals. We will share one of our secret recipes for our sales with you today: We like scanning Czech e-commerce sites on a regular basis and forecasting who is using which data tools, or who plays it by ear. Whenever we think “they don’t use data” and sense good potential for change for the better, we like offering a helping hand.

That this method works has real proofs. One such example is Lékárna.cz, the first Czech online pharmacy, where you can not only buy your drugs, but also can get advice from real pharmacists. Lekarna.cz is now our client. They were facing the hard step up from data rookie to data-driven company. **We spoke to the company CEO, Karel Klodner, about how they coped with the transformation from small business to one of the top 15 e-shops in the country.**

**You have been running Lékárna.cz since 2013. How has the company changed in that time?**

I joined at a difficult time. In2013 it was the first in twelve years that Lékárna.cz had not grown year over year, and that is a steep fall after annual increases of a turnover by 300% from the beginning of our e-commerce business era. After all, we had no competition and thus it was easy to see year over year increase in our business. Then other predators began taking to the field and we suddenly were stagnated. This provoked a series of changes, including personnel changes. Radical steps were required, meaning that the company works very differently now to the way it did those five years ago.

**Where exactly do you see the biggest advancement?**

Beforehand, economic results were evaluated more simply. The fact that we were very successful meant there was no need for comprehensive analyses. We did our evaluations, to exaggerate the point a little, through invoices – costs were X, incomes Y, there was plenty left over on the account, so great, let’s keep going. As soon as one day the money ran out, we began to dig around a bit more. We needed to find ways of saving money, but we lacked elementary data. What are our margins? Which channels are loss-making? Are we overpaying for shipping? We didn’t know the answers to these types of questions because we were only using administrative interface, where each manager had his own set of statistics from which he or she drew data. Thus the resulting company-wide figures could be fairly distorted because they didn’t come from the same database. There were also around 15 interpretations of gross margin running together at the same time and perhaps only the person who submitted them had any idea how this was calculated. So it became clear that the area of data, its collection and its analysis was crucial and it is there that I undoubtedly see a massive step forward.

**So you contacted Keboola to help with the data?**

Keboola actually found us, but we have been in contact since last spring. Their solutions appealed to me right away. However, it took some time before our cooperation started. First, we had to finish the in-house changes we had been working on since I came to Lekárna.cz.

**What was the most difficult aspect of introducing in-house changes?**

Introducing the new ERP system was quite a handful, as was balancing ouraccounting and warehouse processes, which were not taken into consideration at all in the old administrative interface. We needed a set-up in which the manager and the accountant were looking at the same data about margins and everything was in order from the accounting perspective (which in many cases differed greatly from that of the manager). VAT comes into play in figures at the accounts department, various time shifts, other valuation of warehouse stocks, different discount calculations – essentially, it’s an entirely different discipline. We didn’t have to deal with those differences as a small e- commerce site, but once we grew, this need arose.

**Can you remember where was the boundary that you crossed from being a small e-commerce retailer that could almost be run on intuition to a large one that demands this sort of re-setting?**

For us the milestone was turnover of 250 million Czech crowns (accounting for more than 11 million USD). That was when the leisurely approach stopped working. At that point we realised that we would need a proper database. We also needed to change the processes and on top of that also the mindset of people. Just imagine you had been gathering praise for your work the whole time, and then all of a sudden a new management comes to tell you that it was wrong and that the company was not prospering anymore. No surprise that lots of people left. What was crucial for us, however, was for us to move forward fast. We saw our competition taking good decisions based on quality data.

**How long did it all take you?**

Implementing ERP and developing the new website and platforms took three years in the end because we needed radical changes in technology on the one hand, but needed to keep on working for our customers on the other. You cannot simply stop serving your customers. You need to transform on the run. During that same time we also doubled the turnover and the number of employees, which was demanding in the turbulent environment of ongoing change.

**At what stage, then, did Keboola begin helping you?**

We realised in September last year that we were not completely able to pull data together on our own. Several problems arose after launching the new platforms and we assigned our own people to fixing these, first and foremost on the customer-side, meaning that there was insufficient capacity for in-house matters. At the same time, we were lacking internal know-how of how to properly aggregate data. So I contacted Keboola. I must admit that we had a fairly urgent problem at that time and I needed to put basic reports into operation as soon as possible. While the platforms were being built, we worked in such a way that we downloaded data from the database and processed it in Tableau. These exports, however, were not flexible. We were lacking management data in usable format, presented daily, ideally in real time – what we had, however, was more of a jumble of tables and SQL questions.

The team at Keboola listened to what I needed. They offered me a product and a dedicated consultant who would be charged with the task of building these basic reports. Our data is not entirely standard, so I was worried that it would take a long time to set everything up. However, we had everything launched after six weeks. after six weeks both myself and the purchasing department were able to build reports in GoodData. We could now see the trade margin figures, which means that we finally knew what we were making money on and what not. To me, this speed of implementation was an outstanding result of cooperation.

**So you now have management reporting in hand. What are you working on now?**

We are still gradually fine-tuning the whole of the database as such so that we have data and metrics that are uniform for all output. In other words, data integrity as such is still being improved.

We are also moving ahead with marketing reports and are starting the talks of ROI reporting, the effectiveness of channels, segmentation and sources of visitor figures. Warehouse management and stock forecasts are the part of logistic data still to come. And we are aware that those are again an entirely different area.

**How would you sum up management at Lékárna.cz before you started working with Keboola and after the first few months together?**

For me, as CEO, it is mainly about the fact that I can now manage by numbers, using real data in real time. In the past we set everything up as best as we could, but over time it was shown that we had not taken some factor or another into account. For example, we ran a marketing campaign that was unsuccessful, loss-making. But why? We didn’t have the opportunity to evaluate activities right to the core.

As a manager, I was also wary of investing when I didn’t have the foundations, and so I was more cautious and chose the lower degree of risk. Especially in the situation when we have an individual owner and it is not a matter of an investment group pouring in millions on experiments. I was afraid of drowning the company. Now, finally, I have a tool that sets realistic targets, realistic KPI and thanks to which I can invest with a higher degree of certainty. In short, we now work with uniform metrics that everyone respects and trusts and the system is transparent.

**Thank you for speaking to us. We wish you all the best in your onward development!**
