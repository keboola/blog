## How we "hacked" Vizable

by [Milan Veverka](http://blog.keboola.com/author/8793)

Tableau unveiled their new Vizable app the first full day of the Tableau User Conference 2015 (A.K.A. TC-15) to much oohs and aahs. Vizable is a tablet app that allows users to take data from an .xls or .csv file and easily interact with it right on their tablet. It is unparalleled in its ease of use and intuitiveness, providing an exciting new way to consume data and drive insights. More information here: [http://vizable.tableau.com/](http://vizable.tableau.com/ "http://vizable.tableau.com/")

As soon as we saw it, the Keboola team thought, “What an exciting way to use data from Keboola Connection - if only we could send data to it immediately to test it!” The app is built to accept .xls and .csv files that are physically present on the iPad it runs from, so at a glance, it is completely and utterly off-line. We immediately wondered if Keboola Connection - due to its integration with DropBox and Google Drive - could make Vizable the ultimate, on-the-go data visualization app.

(a little bit of frantic _testing_ later)

Yeah! We can easily schedule pushing data into the iPad using our existing integrations. We didn't have to write a single line of code and already during the conference we were able to play with #data15 mentions we’d pulled in through Keboola Connection, with fresh data being automatically pushed into the iPad every 30 minutes.

We eagerly shared our success with the Vizable team and started showing conference attendees and members of the Tableau team just how we’d made it all happen! It was great to receive a string of visits from the whole Vizable crew all the way up to Dave Story, VP of Mobile and Strategic Growth, and Chris Stolte, the Chief Development Officer. What a thrilling way to educate the Tableau folks on all the cool stuff Keboola does with their tool and for their customers.
