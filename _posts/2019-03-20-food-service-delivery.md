#### **Industry Trends**

According to the food service industry analysts, consumer preferences will continue to evolve in 2019 driving a deeper divide between those seeking convenience and those chasing a memorable dining experience\[1\]. In addition, labor acquisition and retention challenges are expected to persist resulting in a growing dependence on technology such as mobile apps, in-store kiosks, tablets for order and inventory management, and automation in kitchens.

#### **The Challenges**

Unfortunately for many businesses, advancement in technology does not always lead to advancement in knowledge or convenience. Instead, restaurant managers frequently find themselves dealing with greater complexities from various POS gadgets and systems that result in fragmented and disparate data limiting their collective usefulness and delayed reporting on some of the most crucial aspects of the business.

Moreover, the need to adapt to changing consumer preferences, smarter inventory management and better staff planning remain as key priorities for restaurant owners and operators today.
