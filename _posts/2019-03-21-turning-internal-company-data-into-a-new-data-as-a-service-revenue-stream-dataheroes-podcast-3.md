In the latest episode of DataHeroes, the host and Keboola’s CEO Pavel Dolezal chats with Michal Buzek, Head of Business Intelligence at Heureka. Michal started his career at Seznam.cz, the biggest search platform in the Czech Republic. After spending several months on a sales position, he joined the analytical department and became its head three years later. Michal explains how the short hands-on experience in sales influenced his take on data analytics.

With almost 10 years of experience at Seznam under his belt, Michal was ready for a new challenge. He was aware of the opportunities that turning internal data into a service could offer to companies and wanted to tap the uncovered potential by joining Heureka in 2016.

Heureka is the leading e-commerce shopping platform in Central and Eastern Europe. With its portfolio of price comparison websites, it holds market leader positions in nine European countries. Over 20 million unique users visit the platform every month, looking for the best sites to shop for products from Heureka’s catalogue of 25 million items. Having one of the biggest data samples about e-retail in the region to their disposal, Heureka’s CEO decided to build Data-as-a-Service on top of that. And that’s where Michal came into the picture.

In a matter of months, he and his team launched a new service for Heureka’s business partners – brands and e-retailers. The service provides up-to-date information about their campaigns and the e-commerce market as a whole. Almost in real time, companies can identify best-selling products and categories, benchmark themselves against the competition, etc. Heureka now plans on monetizing the service with advanced reports.
