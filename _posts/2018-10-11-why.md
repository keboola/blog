## Why aren’t there more nerds in marketing?

by [Kate Thomas](http://blog.keboola.com/author/14560)

My arrival at Business Intelligence (BI) and eventually consulting for Keboola was not through your standard Statistics or Programming route. After completing a Bachelor’s degree in Business & Communications, I had several stints coordinating corporate marketing efforts in various industries from Automotive to Gaming. I found that no matter what capacity I worked in - from tracking call-to-actions, to analyzing performance reports from suppliers and conducting market research - I could not hide from data. 

So in my never ending quest for efficiency I also started to ask myself why am I doing this and how meaningful is it? Or simply put, am I wasting my time coming up with tweets no one reads. #HashtagAllTheThings

Traditionally data analysis was never a core a competency of marketing, someone else from purchasing, finance, IT etc. would tell you if your campaign was successful. But with the shift towards digital marketing there’s been an increase in data availability and now more control over how marketers themselves can measure KPIs.

It was this trend that made me first curious about making the switch from Marketing to Analytics. The organizational gap was so apparent to me, but I had no idea what that translated to in terms of a job description. I was stuck between working in marketing where (for obvious reasons) the primary focus is on campaign implementation before measurement vs. a highly technical position (which I didn’t even have the qualifications for) that would stifle my creative side.

Caught in the middle, I came across a job posting at Keboola for a “[Data Analyst](http://www.keboola.com/jobs/vancouver)”. At the time I had no idea what I was applying for, but through my experience in the past year I now see that the job description couldn’t have been clearer. Keboola, like me, is somewhere in the middle. With a pragmatic approach, we provide real solutions to our clients’ very real business issues.  

What I love about working here is that we help companies integrate both Market Intelligence (MI) and Business Intelligence (BI) for data-driven decision making.

In my role, I provide the (BI) tools to answer the “why” behind my clients’ marketing decisions and then visualize those findings so they can make more informed decisions (MI). What I’ve found through this experience that there are common problems afflicting marketers, for which I feel there is actually a solution already under your nose. My job at Keboola is to translate these observations into something actionable so marketers can be empowered to work with their data and spend their time creating something meaningful … less hashtags in the next tweet perhaps?
