title: Why Citizen-Data Scientists, Not Professionals, Are the Future
perex: Teaching people across an organization basic data analytics is more valuable
  than deepening the machine learning abilities. Data professionals should be ones
  leading the way.

**Don't get me wrong; it's terrific that more companies are talking about and starting to try to work with data. Most companies, even now in 2019, are making decisions based on nothing more than a gut feeling. After watching themselves get outrun by data-driven companies, these organizations are starting to warm up to the idea of making data-based business decisions.**

**However, the data-driven function of a company is not defined by the number of data specialists. Instead, it's all about the mindsets of the people outside of the data/BI teams, and how easily they can consume and act upon reliable data.**

If you're reading this, there's a good chance you're a data professional who wants to try to get ahead of the curve. You might consume content from a site like KDnuggets, discuss the latest on deep learning algorithms and specialized apps with your peers, or laugh to yourself whenever you hear someone use the term AI without understanding that it's often more of a philosophical concept than a technical one. You probably take pride in your work, as you should, knowing that you are helping to push your company into the 21st century.

Some would argue that 99% of companies out there would see more business value in optimizing the organization as a whole instead of investing that time and energy into any narrow application. Providing non-technical employees with relevant data and teaching them how to analyze, use, and act upon it is far more rewarding than most initiatives to strengthen the technical ability in machine learning.

While "data is the new oil" is an overused term, it's still pretty accurate since consumers tend to buy and use gasoline every day. Data isn't a new atomic power that can only be used by a few scientific specialists who turn around and create a massive amount of value for society as a whole; it's something that can be understood and used by anyone. Instead of trying to teach every driver how to extract oil and refine it into gasoline, you only have to show them where the gas stations are and how to pump it into their cars.

Most companies make a profit by having people work together in a complex and complicated mechanism in which every person has a specific role and value, from the front desk security guard to the CEO.

Unfortunately, companies nowadays are typically only looking at deep learning applications that only improve one cog of the machine. While it is possible to improve the standing of a company by optimizing one cogwheel at a time, the usual scenario is that a company will invest in tens, if not hundreds, of specialized apps and algorithms and see little to no improvement in their day to day business, and any value that’s created stays within the apps themselves. Some companies, like Uber or Spotify, can significantly increase their revenues by improving their data science models, but most companies don't have that opportunity.

Instead of focusing on investing in highly trained and specialized data teams in one department, organizations would generally be better off spending their time and resources investing in data amateurs throughout their company.

Companies around the world are finally waking up to this fact and are starting to realize that the R&D projects they've been sinking money into over the last few years are becoming commodities with a much lower price tag. Bummer, right?

Now, does this mean that data professionals should worry about their job security? Not at all.

How can we be so sure? Just look at the field of IT.

Historically, your IT services were considered utilities. Later, IT became an integral part of the company's business, so much so that the head of IT eventually evolved into the newly recognized role of CTO. With digitalization and the CTO role being at its peak, more and more CTOs are becoming successors to CEOs, even in organizations that weren't historically considered tech companies.

Currently, we see the same happening with data. Most companies still see data and business intelligence departments as the people who take care of infrastructure, fix things, and solve business inquiries. But, more and more companies are starting to wake up and see the potential of data, meaning that it will become much more common that data specialists will rise into management. CIOs, along with other data management roles, will gain more recognition, responsibilities, and will have a greater say in the business as a whole.

Right now, we're in that transition stage. While nearly every successful company is employing data specialists, only a handful of them can be considered genuinely data-driven. This evolution can mean enormous opportunity for data professionals to step up their game and take the lead.

For most of today's business applications, you need someone who's skilled, specialized, and experienced enough to look at the data, make sense of all of it, then dictate what decisions the business should take next. To be more effective, you want everyone in your organization to be capable of and have the ability to access and work with data. Since different organization members are experts in their own fields, they can give context and bear the responsibilities of the decisions they make. To empower them, we just need to provide them with better tools.

Typically, in an organization, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, which is why data professionals should start looking wider, not deeper. The number of curious people in an organization that want to take advantage of insights that the business intelligence department can give them is rising, as is the number of business professionals learning SQL. Teaching those within the organization to work with data, building a self-serving infrastructure, and making sure that everyone can access the data they need to make better decisions are of much higher value to an organization than any new ML app.

The future of data belongs to the people, not the elitists. The more that people within an organization realize the value of understanding, working, and possibly becoming enthusiastic about data, the better position their data professionals will be in.
