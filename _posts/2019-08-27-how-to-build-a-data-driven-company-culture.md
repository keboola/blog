## Learn how to use data to unlock your company’s growth

Data is said to be the [new oil](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data) and just like oil, unlocking the full potential of data can come at a steep cost.

Before you can start using data, you need to **invest in the technology for collecting, cleaning, hosting and maintaining that data**. Let’s also not forget the salaries of data engineers, scientists, and analysts - they are an investment. Business decision-makers must ask themselves how to leverage data to turn a profit.

Building a strong data culture is the answer to this question.

Research from MIT suggests companies that invest in data-driven decision-making benefit from a [5-6% higher output and productivity](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1819486). To put it in monetary terms, analytics pays back [$13.01 for every dollar spent](https://nucleusresearch.com/research/single/analytics-pays-back-13-01-for-every-dollar-spent/).

That may sound great on paper, but how does one build a data-driven culture within their company? We’re going to guide to a more data-driven culture in four easy steps:

1. Start with business decision making
2. Ensure data quality
3. Democratize data access across departments and people
4. Build your data into processes and products

## Start with business decision making

_“The fundamental objective in collecting, analyzing, and deploying data is to make better decisions.”_ (McKinsley: [Why data culture matters](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinsey-analytics/our-insights/why-data-culture-matters))

In a data-driven company, data comes second. The first priority is decision making. As such, the project of building a data-driven culture starts with business decisions first.

These business decisions should coincide with critical questions to the core decision-makers. What questions should we be asking and answering w to help us get ahead of our competitors? What data would we need to decide what our next product offering should be? How is our product performing on the market?

To drive strategic changes, **start by agreeing on common business goals** and what metrics are relevant to measure their achievement across the whole organization. Turn those metrics into KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), then start measuring and reporting them.

## Ensure data quality

Data-driven decisions are as good as the foundation they are based on.

Being able to guarantee data quality can foster trust and gives decision-makers confidence to rely on that data. That said, quality can seem an elusive concept.

It boils down to two aspects:

1. Ensure the technical infrastructure supporting data acquisition and consumption is well-engineered, and
2. Make data easily available and understandable to decision-makers.

From a technical standpoint, companies must strive to apply the best engineering practices when it comes to data. The entire [ETL pipeline](https://www.stitchdata.com/etldatabase/etl-process/) must run like a well-oiled machine.

Data sources are smoothly integrated with databases and data lakes. The transformations between data types and flow between different modules are seamless. The entire infrastructure is monitored for errors as well as fault-tolerant. **A well-engineered pipeline centralizes different data sources and can** [**flexibly adapt to changes**](https://www.stitchdata.com/etldatabase/etl-challenges/).

In other words, your infrastructure can support your growth and scale with you.

From a people perspective, make sure to develop an understandable (non-technical) language, spoken across departments and shareholders.

In practice this involves naming your data in an easy-to-interpret way, agreeing on what the definitions of your core concepts are, and all the other micro-processes, which [speed up data interpretation](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/23/five-building-blocks-of-a-data-driven-culture/).

## Democratize data access across departments and people

Different departments consult different data for their decision making.

Sales relies on their CRM, technical support consults their ticketing system when dealing with requests, and marketing looks at digital platforms to evaluate ad performance.

When crucial information is locked in these data silos it prevents your company from developing a cross-department data-driven culture.

Having many sources of truth allows for as many different views on the same customer. Opening the door to he-said-she-said arguments.

Data being locked in silos is also problematic from a technical standpoint. **Multiple data pipelines are harder to monitor and maintain.** This can lead to some data being stale and outdated by the time a department uses it to make decisions.

Break data silos and bring data across departments. **Empower everyone to make data-driven decisions on their own** by relying on a centralized, [single source of truth](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/single-source-of-truth-SSOT)**.** Without the need to rely on others for access or interpretation.

**Data-driven culture is about developing a single source of data and a common language to talk about it**. Read more about the [business best practices](https://blog.keboola.com/opening-silos-the-only-way-to-achieve-company-goals) when opening silos.

## Build your data into processes and products

As Keboola’s [CEO Pavel Dolezal](https://blog.keboola.com/pavel-dolezal-interview-lupa) put it: “It’s never enough to put data together and create _insights_. We need to create new _processes._”

This means **building processes and products based on data**.

In other words, a company does not just use data. Instead, it relies on data for its core offerings and operations.

This can take the form of KPIs and dashboards for regular performance monitoring. But data can also be ingrained in the core of your product and services, such as building products using machine learning and AI.

A data-driven culture goes beyond paying lip service to data. It puts data where the money is. At the heart of the company.

## Culture is a process, not a state

Just like growing your company, building a data-driven culture can take time.

Focus your efforts on the four pillars of decision-making, data quality, data accessibility, and core-product to reap the benefits of a data-driven culture. Keboola is here to help you out. [Let’s hop on a call and discuss options.](https://www.keboola.com/request-demo)
