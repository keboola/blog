"_The whole thing is a bit complicated_…" started Vojta, one of Keboola’s consultants, over an English breakfast in the coffee shop with the best coffee in Prague. He was right. **It was complicated**. But a few hours (and a pint of coffee) I got pretty good idea what was going on. Here, I will try to relay it to you.

> **Intro**: Companies today often have enough data to get completely lost in it and it is unfathomable to put it into context and extract any useful meaning. Even if they can, there are high costs associated with time and money.

## Finding the gold in the data

Keboola does something called data **ETL** (Extract, Transform, Load). It sounds (just like many other fancy terms from this field) more complicated than it is.

Keboola helps you:

**1 - Identify**, **locate** and **pull together** all data relevant to your business from both your own and third-party sources. Anything from accounting and ERP systems to some related open-data initiatives of the government to comments on your Facebook pages. This is the _Extract_ stage.

2 - They **manage** the whole load, **organize** it into a structure in which one can meaningfully work with it. That’s _Transform_.

3 - Then the data is **pushed into the system** or application selected for the final consumption - _Load_.

The toolset that Keboola uses to perform (amongst other things) the ETL tasks, is their own **Keboola Connection**.

The platform that Keboola uses for the analytics and producing all of those wondrous charts and dashboards is [GoodData](http://www.gooddata.com/).

## So what is it all good for?

You’ve got data. **Lots of it**.

To give it meaning, the data needs to be **pre-processed**, the pieces put in order and with the right context, so that GoodData will give you the results you need. That is what Keboola is for:

Helping you to **find meaning** in your data.  
**Continuously processes** your data using Keboola Connection  
Sets up GoodData so you can **find the answers you need**. Answers to questions like "_how much revenue did we get from customers brought to us by the expensive marketing campaign from last fall_?” or “_what impact does weather have on our sales people’s performance_?” Or **whatever else** comes to mind.

Keboola can do all of that pretty fast and practically without limitations. If you have any questions about what our software can do, then make sure to [contact us](https://www.keboola.com/contact)!
