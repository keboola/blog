### **Marie Havlíčková, Slevomat CEO: Data helps us to speed up our day-to-day strategic and business decisions**

 We at Keboola believe that, first and foremost, data should be useful and accessible to anyone whom it can help to make better decisions, rather than just to a handful of analysts or data nerds. With this in mind, we always need to find the right form for a company that will make decision-making easier. We prefer to seek out partners who, thanks to Keboola Connection, can also push for data democratisation at companies. We found common ground quickly with the guys from[ Bizz Treat](https://www.bizztreat.com/). Our joint partnership has been right on time for when Slevomat started their journey towards making data-driven decisions.

Slevomat, the biggest discount portal based in the Czech Republic, needs no introduction for Czech based internet users! All of them would have heard about them at some point while surfing the web. This biggest discount portal has been operating in the Czech Republic since 2010. It is now focusing primarily on the market in experiences and packages for those going on breaks. Last year, there was a change of the companies owner, which triggered a plethora of changes. If the company was to implement its new strategy and business goals, it also needed to innovate its data work. It gradually began to build its strategic and business decisions on data on a daily basis. We talked to Slevomat CEO, Marie Havlíčková (Chytilová), about what the path to a data-driven business looks like in practice.

**How has Slevomat worked with data in the past? What service were you using?**

We developed data reporting internally and combined it with data exports to excel spreadsheets. We didn’t use any external services. All of the reports we needed were created by our IT department.

**Why did you decide to move away from this system?** 

I’m sure you can imagine how much work any change in the data processing system required. I dare say that routine business reporting overloaded our IT capacities to the extent that reporting operations even technically complicated the normal running of Slevomat. The problems here then infiltrated all company departments.

 **If you managed to keep going like that all those years, what was the decisive impulse or major problem that forced you to innovate?**

Besides the workload I have mentioned, which was becoming intolerable, it just didn’t work the way we needed. In our original system with excellent spreadsheets, it was almost impossible to get daily updated business data overviews. Besides that, for our management decisions we often needed to combine data from different sources into a single overview, and that was out of the question in the original system. Another key factor has been that we need to be able to keep track of what is helping our business on any given day and where we need to put out fires. For example, we needed to monitor how sales staff were fulfilling sales quotas at any level of detail and in relation to the traffic on our site. Which vouchers are our bestsellers, what campaigns and sales channels are helping us most, and how does each member of our sales staff contribute to the sales results? Getting quick answers to all these questions was unnecessarily laborious, and verging on the impossible.

 **How did Keboola catch your eye when you were looking for an alternative?**

What excited us most was the ability to integrate all data sources into a single point. This gives us a single data overview and we can work with unlimited combinations of data parameters. At the same time, the flexibility with which new requirements can be entered and changes in reporting can be configured was promising in terms of the relief it would bring. In short, business data is readily available for our everyday business operations.

**Was the transition to the new system difficult?**

No, it wasn’t actually, and I was pleasantly surprised by the overall speed of implementation of Keboola Connection and the great job done by the people at Bizz Treat. We were ready in a matter of weeks. I appreciated the very nimble approach to innovations in reporting, and the fact that we didn’t need any lengthy months of drawn-out analysis. We simply took a close but swift look at our business model, and we got a solution tailored to suit our needs straight away. Not only was everything smooth, but our work with data is now much more convenient for us. The people at Slevomat also took to it very quickly. A big plus for them is that they can visualise the ongoing progress in the business plan. They can see immediately whether they are in step with the plan. And if they aren’t, it’s easy to decide how to come up with a fix. In addition, all this information on the implementation of the plan is public, so everyone can see how well they are doing compared to their co-workers whenever they want. Everyone can see this data. Although I was initially worried about publishing the results of each individual, it has proved to be a great motivator. No one wants to be last, but at the same time colleagues help each other to do a good job. Data helps not only top management, but is also useful for every single member of sales staff, helping them to improve their work every day.

**What do you expect of Keboola Connection from a business perspective?**

It’s simple. The introduction of a new way of working with data and reporting has helped us to increase sales by 23% thanks to our sales staff selling 34% more vouchers than before. By seeing up-to-date data, you can better evaluate not only the company-wide KPI’s, but also your own personal fulfilment of targets. I don’t think it would be an exaggeration to say that data helps us to improve and speed up our day-to-day business and strategic decisions. And that helps us to stay a step ahead of our rivals and maintain our lead on the market in experiences and city- and country-break packages.

**Thanks for the inspiring chat. We hope you continue to meet and exceed your targets with ease in the future!**
