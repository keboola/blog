Distributed data teams are everywhere. Whether we are talking enterprise, where people working on projects together are in different offices, buildings, countries or on different continents, or about smaller companies that often prefer quality over proximity when it comes to talent acquisition. Now we need to add global pandemic as another reason why preparedness for distributed workforce may be a key advantage for an organization.

There are several schools of approach to distributed work. They span the whole spectrum from deniers that it is even a thing (how do you know those people actually work, right?) to the absolute nightmares of commercial real estate brokers (what do I need an office for in the first place?). For the purpose of this article, let’s just agree that it indeed IS a thing, and perhaps more important today than ever.

I will stay away from addressing the common challenges of distributed work and the common techniques of how to mitigate them. Much has been written on that. When it comes to distributed **data** teams specifically, there are three main obstacles, or (sometimes very sound) reasons why NOT do it:

* Security
* Collaboration
* Interdependence

Let’s attack them one by one.

## Security

This is a sticky one. What are the company’s infrastructure and data tool set, and how does it lead itself to secure distributed work? Data scientists in coffee shops with their laptops with a physical copy of the files & their work environment, an administrator connecting to server console remotely, USB sticks with data dumps and excel sheets - all those are any serious security team’s worst nightmares. 

Once the company infrastructure is predominantly cloud-based, perhaps with a BringYourOwnDevice policy, things get a bit easier by definition - the office now becomes just “one place to connect from” rather than “the place where the data IS, and lots of those issues are already solved. 

Add to it some advanced authorization mechanisms such as MFA with physical keys and solid audit trail, clear password policies and your team is perhaps much more ready than you think.

## Collaboration

“What does this have to do with data? You said you will not talk about the generic stuff…” Well. Collaboration over data has its specifics. If you and your teammate are across town, are you looking at the same version of data? You make a change to a code or a report, will they see that? Will it collide with their recent changes? Are you both working on the same thing without knowing? 

Those issues, while not insurmountable, are creating an additional overhead that is taxing the remote work’s productivity. Often they require the deployment of additional tools just to de-risk the operations (think version control, code deployment, data synchronization - there is a tool for everything out there). That, in turn, is driving the complexity of the setup.

## Interdependence

Sounds related, but it is different from Collaboration. While Collaboration is about working with your peers, interdependence refers to the need to involve someone from a different department to enable you to do your job. Typical examples may be a data analyst in the marketing department needing a new data set from the BI team, or a data scientist needing IT to get more memory for their workspace, or an upgrade of a version of their tool. 

While this is a pain even during regular office hours, your request is now in someone’s queue, while it is likely that someone has other priorities you are completely unaware of, and now you need to solve the dilemma of how much to push them or whether to escalate to your boss who can possibly talk to their boss. That’s if they’re your “cousins” on the org chart, otherwise, this may need several layers of people talking to each other to get solved or prioritized. Now imagine those people in different places and possibly different time zones. One key member of the chain on vacation and you’re screwed. Well, your request is. 

An automated data ops platform is taking all those issues on, and creating a massive degree of autonomy, when people are empowered to help themselves within the confines of the company’s rules and requirements. And of course, everything is tracked, as the reasons why some companies do not allow for this are security concerns.

## Empower your distributed data teams

The demands for a data environment dealing with all those issues are many and they are complex. Designing a stack that will support all that is not for the faint of heart. It is where a data-ops automation platform, whose creators took all those issues into consideration at its inception and which went through the evolution of those needs in time, makes companies much more competitive in the distributed landscape.
