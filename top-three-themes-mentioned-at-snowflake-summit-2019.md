We had a great time at the Snowflake Summit last week with customers and fellow partners! Thanks for coming up to our booth and sharing your thoughts on your experiences with Snowflake. A few main topics kept coming up that we thought were worth sharing.

  
**1. Data Ingestion into Snowflake**

The big question on everyone’s mind was “How DO you get all of your data into Snowflake?” Folks chatted about disparate source systems they used, connecting several ETL tools, and their experiences with custom code hosting. We shared that our customers had two favorite ways to ingest data: one was to use one of Keboola’s many (over 100) out-of-the-box connections or to create one of their own custom connections in Keboola coding in whatever language they wanted which conveniently became an integral part of their data architecture system.

**2. Managing data architecture and its complexity with Snowflake**

Speaking of data architecture, managing data architecture and its complexity was one of the hottest topics on the booth floor. Everyone agreed that Snowflake is the database of choice, but several other pieces are needed to complete the Snowflake puzzle to really leverage it - ETL tools, process management, scheduling, data catalog, data science notebooks. All of these need to be integrated together to provide centralized logs and user management. Don’t forget data lineage or audit trails! Keboola integrates those (and more) functionalities into one SaaS platform that is provided with the guarantee that it works together. If you’re curious to see the demo we shared at Snowflake [grab it here](https://www.keboola.com/request-demo).

  
**3. Best Practices on Your Snowflake Environment**

The last topic we heard repeatedly was about advice on best practices for keeping your Snowflake environment from getting too messy. Folks asked a variety of questions such as “How do I get rid of those hundreds of temporary tables?” and “How do I stop my warehouses from running needlessly?” to “Who would you advise on the team to manage the environment?” Our customers keep it pretty simple: Keboola automates their “data ops” layer for Snowflake, including garbage collection, provisioning and load balancing of their warehouses, as well as keeping meticulous records of usage and their user activities - we make it easy not to just collect, but also consume the telemtry data. Because Keboola is managing their environment, our customers teams can focus on what they want to achieve with data rather than spend time on the infrastructure. What Snowflake does for the database, Keboola does for the whole architecture!
